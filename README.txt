Project 4For4
Ryan Zhou, Ryan Qi & Dingheng Yan


Description:
This project consists of a tiny web-minigame about words that have lengths of 4 letters. Under a time limit, players have to 'connect' the previous word with the last letter from the previous word by appending a word that starts with it(Example: "worD" - "Dorm"). There are three gamemodes as well as an background music tracks available for each gamemode, but players can sure turn them off and using their own favorite music while playing, and the gamemodes are a Minecraft Reference:
    "Peaceful": There will be 400 seconds available
    "Normal": Only 275 seconds available
    "HARDCORE": Only 275 seconds and *secret rule* will be applied

Rules:
1.  NO REPETITION, any detection of repetition in any way will Force The Game To Stop and record your score without the repeated one.
2.  4 points will be rewarded for each successful 'connection'(see 'connect' for definition), however, if there is censored word used, the player will only get 1 point only instead of 4.
3.  (*secret rule*) Suspicious behavior including multiple instances with same word as beginning will result in a deduction of 2 points for each attempt.

Background Music Tracks:
(Even though this is a small game, ALL CREDIT goes to the owners of their respective piece of music used in this game as background + links to YouTube music videos in-game)
Peaceful: 
Normal: 
Hardcore: 


Constraints:
Due to limited advancement for handwritten-to-text recognition with Javascript as well as insufficient training time, there are instances where AI fails to recognize certain text, so please write as neat as possible while playing.
Additionally, due to limited time for overall working on this project(~4hrs only), we've made relatively tiny progress on the project and realized the importance of prototyping and time management as this ends our first experience on hacking events.
